## Mock Data Integration

The application uses a comprehensive mock data system that simulates real API responses:

- **Incidents**: Theft, unattended objects, vandalism, and suspicious activity alerts
- **Cameras**: Multi-location camera network with health monitoring
- **Settings**: Configurable alert thresholds and notification preferences

All mock services include realistic delays and error handling to simulate production API behavior.

## Development Guidelines

### Component Architecture
- **Atomic Design**: Components organized by complexity and reusability
- **Props Interface**: Consistent prop patterns with proper TypeScript-style destructuring
- **State Management**: React hooks with proper dependency arrays and cleanup

### Styling Standards
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first approach with custom color system
- **Dark Mode**: Full dark theme support with automatic system detection
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with proper breakpoint usage
- **Animation**: Framer Motion for state transitions and micro-interactions

### Code Quality
- **ES6+ Standards**: Modern JavaScript with async/await patterns
- **Import Organization**: Consistent import order with @/ path aliasing
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch blocks with user-friendly messages
- **Loading States**: Skeleton loaders and loading indicators for all async operations

## Customization

### Theme Configuration
Modify `tailwind.config.js` to customize:
- Color palette and gradients
- Typography scale and font families
- Spacing and border radius values
- Animation timing and easing functions

### Mock Data
Update JSON files in `src/services/mockData/` to customize:
- Incident types and descriptions
- Camera locations and configurations
- Default system settings and preferences

### API Integration
Replace mock services in `src/services/api/` with real API calls:
- Update service methods to use actual endpoints
- Modify response handling for real data structures
- Add authentication headers and error handling

## Performance Optimization

- **Lazy Loading**: Components and routes loaded on demand
- **Image Optimization**: Proper fallback handling and loading states
- **Animation Performance**: Hardware-accelerated transforms and optimized timing
- **Bundle Optimization**: Vite-based build with automatic code splitting

## Security Considerations

- **Input Validation**: All form inputs properly validated and sanitized
- **XSS Prevention**: Proper escaping of user-generated content
- **CSRF Protection**: Token-based protection for state-changing operations
- **Privacy Controls**: Face blur functionality and data anonymization options
